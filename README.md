Space Invaders, arcade game created by Japanese engineer and game designer Nishikado Tomohiro in 1978 and produced by Japanese electronic game manufacturer Taito Corp. The objective of Space Invaders, which was one of the earliest video games released, is to pan across a screen and shoot descending swarms of aliens, preventing them from reaching the bottom of the screen.
Space Invaders is a very simple game by modern standards, but it was a technological marvel in its time. Typical levels consist of a player piloting a laser cannon to battle columns of descending aliens while using shields to block alien fire. The speed of the alien approach increases as the game progresses, adding to the tension. A bonus alien spaceship appears from time to time, which offers the player an opportunity to score additional points by blowing it up.
